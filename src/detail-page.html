                        <p>The Temple of Artemis (or Artemision), sometimes called the Temple of Diana, was a Greek temple located in Ephesus (present-day Turkey).
        The temple was dedicated to the goddess Artemis and was actually destroyed and rebuilt three times, the final of which was considered one
        of the Seven Ancient Wonders. By 401 AD, the temple had been destroyed, and only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain.
        While little is known about the temple’s appearance, Antipater of Sidon, who described the Seven Wonders said:
        
        “…when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, ‘Lo, apart from Olympus,
        the Sun never looked on aught so grand.’”
