<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, 
page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
🟢 #7. Meta Tag attribute="charset" - UTF-8 - Unicode Transformation Format - The charset attribute specifies the character 
encoding for the HTML document. The HTML5 specification encourages web developers 
to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters 
and symbols in the world!

 and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. Before tablets and mobile phones, 
 web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design 
 and a fixed size.
